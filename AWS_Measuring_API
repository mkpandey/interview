KPIs for Measuring API Impact in AWS
When evaluating the impact of your APIs in AWS, it's essential to track key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into usage, performance, and user experience. Here are some essential KPIs to consider:

Usage KPIs
API Calls: The total number of API calls made over a specific period.
API Usage Frequency: The average number of API calls per user or application.
API Usage Patterns: Identify peak usage times, popular endpoints, and usage trends.
API User Growth: Track the number of new and returning API users.


Performance KPIs
API Latency: The average time it takes for an API request to be processed and a response returned.
API Error Rates: The percentage of API requests that result in errors or exceptions.
API Throughput: The maximum number of API requests that can be handled concurrently.
API Scalability: Measure how well the API can handle increased load and traffic.


User Experience KPIs
API Response Time: The perceived latency experienced by users.
API Error Rates (User-Facing): Track the number of errors that directly impact users.
API Documentation Usage: Measure the effectiveness of your API documentation.
API Feedback: Collect user feedback on API usability, functionality, and performance.


Business Impact KPIs
API Revenue: If applicable, track the revenue generated by API usage.
API Cost: Monitor the costs associated with running and maintaining your APIs.
API ROI: Calculate the return on investment for your API development and management efforts.
Tools and Services
AWS provides a range of tools and services to help you collect and analyze these KPIs:

Amazon CloudWatch: Monitor API metrics such as latency, errors, and throughput.
Amazon API Gateway: Track API usage, performance, and integration with AWS services.
AWS Lambda: Measure the performance of serverless functions used in your APIs.
Amazon Kinesis: Collect and process real-time data streams from your APIs.
AWS X-Ray: Trace and debug API requests to identify performance bottlenecks.


By tracking these KPIs and leveraging AWS tools, you can gain valuable insights into your API's impact, identify areas for improvement, and optimize its performance to meet the needs of your users and business objectives.
